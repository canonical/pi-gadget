#cloud-config

# This is the user-data configuration file for cloud-init. By default,
# cloud-init does very little because the desktop image provides an interactive
# first time setup interface, which runs when no user is present on boot.
#
# The following line inhibits cloud-init's creation of the default user. Should
# you wish to have cloud-init configure your desktop install instead, bypassing
# the interactive first time setup, comment or remove this line, then proceed
# to customize the rest of the configuration as desired.
users: []

# Some examples of customization are provided in comments below; please refer
# to the cloud-init documentation for full details of the configuration format:
#
# https://cloudinit.readthedocs.io/
#
# Please note that the YAML format employed by this file is sensitive to
# differences in whitespace; if you are editing this file in an editor (like
# Notepad) which uses literal tabs, take care to only use spaces for
# indentation. See the following link for more details:

## On first boot, set the (default) ubuntu user's password to "ubuntu" and
## expire user passwords
#chpasswd:
#  expire: true
#  users:
#  - name: ubuntu
#    password: ubuntu
#    type: text

## Set the system's hostname. Please note that, unless you have a local DNS
## setup where the hostname is derived from DHCP requests (as with dnsmasq),
## setting the hostname here will not make the machine reachable by this name.
## You may also wish to install avahi-daemon (see the "packages:" key below)
## to make your machine reachable by the .local domain
#hostname: ubuntu

## On first boot, use ssh-import-id to give the specific users SSH access to
## the default user
#ssh_import_id:
#- lp:my_launchpad_username
#- gh:my_github_username

## Add users and groups to the system, and import keys with the ssh-import-id
## utility
#groups:
#- robot: [robot]
#- robotics: [robot]
#- pi
#
#users:
#- default
#- name: robot
#  gecos: Mr. Robot
#  primary_group: robot
#  groups: users
#  ssh_import_id: foobar
#  lock_passwd: false
#  passwd: $5$hkui88$nvZgIle31cNpryjRfO9uArF7DYiBcWEnjqq7L1AQNN3

## Update apt database and upgrade packages on first boot
#package_update: true
#package_upgrade: true

## Install additional packages on first boot

#- inkscape
#- fritzing
#- python3-gpiozero
#- [python3-serial, 3.5-1]
